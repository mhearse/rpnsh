rpnsh
=========

In my college days, I developed a fondness for Reverse Polish Notation.  

All the Linux/Unix shells that I've used over the years have been algebraic.  So here's my attempt to bring RPN to the command line.

The present effort simply translates RPN style input to bash commands.  It will include a history and command builder.

Still Proof of concept.
